## NeoPixel_Hue_Rotater by *@tinkerer9*


#### Acreditations

- Thanks to ***@adrianotiger*** for rainbow NeoPixel code (generated from <https://adrianotiger.github.io/Neopixel-Effect-Generator/>
- Thanks to everyone on [Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/) for helping out with problems along the way.

#### How to use

- Click the button to switch [modes](https://github.com/tinkerer9/NeoPixel_Hue_Rotater/blob/main/README.md#modes) (mode # displayed on small NeoPixel strip):
- Rotate potentiometer labeled *Brightness* to change brightnesses of both strips
- Rotate potentiometer labeled *LED/Hue* to change brightness of the LED on modes 1, 3, 4, and 5. Use it to change the hue on mode 2.

> On mode 5 (show temp/humidity), the blue light means the humidity and the red light means tempature. If there is one purple light, then that means temp AND humidity.

#### Modes

The NeoPixel_Hue_Rotater has 5 modes:
  1. White light
  2. Select hue
  3. Rainbow (boring)
  4. Rainbow (cool)
  5. Show temp/humidity
  
> ##### Difference between mode 3 & 4:
> Mode 3 is a modifacation of mode 2 that changes hue automatically. All the pixels are the same color.
Mode 4 has all pixels different colors. Just like a rainbow circle, except it spins.
See for yourself.
